--[[
Greetings, traveler! Welcome to the Mystic Moon Potion Shop.

As a fledging new programmer in town, youâ€™ve been enlisted to 
build a system to help this potion shop organize its operations.

The Mystic Moon Potion Shop has a lot of information to keep 
track of: inventory, customers, prices, sales, employees, shipping, 
receiving, and on and on.

Your task for this project is to create a system to generate 
receipts for each purchase. You will put together basic item 
information, the item total including tax, and display it all 
in receipt format.
